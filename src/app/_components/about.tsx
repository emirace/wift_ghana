            A network of women called Women in Film and Television Ghana (WIFT
            Ghana) is working to create a more diverse film, television, and
            digital media landscape. We aim to close the gender gap in
            production,leadership, and narrative as a chapter of Women in Film
            and Television International (WIFTI), which hasmore than 50 chapters
            worldwide. Filmmakers, producers, screenwriters, performers, and
            mediaprofessionals dedicated to promoting innovation and career
            advancement make up our membership. Inour opinion, a completely
            female-represented sector will be more dynamic and more
            representative of a range of viewpoints. Through our programs, we
            hope to provide women in all facets of media with thetools and
            chances they need to succeed. Professionals such as actors, writers,
            producers, and directors are among our members. Since we thinkthat
            diversity and inclusion are essential to building a thriving and
            prosperous sector, we strive to givewomen from all backgrounds the
            chance to thrive. Through our efforts, we seek to encourage women
            inour sector to thrive, follow their aspirations, have access to a
            network of support, and gain economicempowerment for all future
            generations.
